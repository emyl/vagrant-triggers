# vagrant-triggers

Allow the definition of arbitrary scripts that will run on the host before and/or after Vagrant commands.

## Installation

Ensure you have downloaded and installed Vagrant from the
[Vagrant downloads page](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/).

Installation is performed in the prescribed manner for Vagrant 1.1+ plugins.

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers

## Usage

### Basic usage

The following ```Vagrantfile``` configuration options are added:

```
trigger.before :command, { :option => "value", ... }
```

```
trigger.after :command, { :option => "value", ... }
```

The first argument is the command in which the trigger will be tied. It could be an array (e.g. ```[:up, :resume]```) in case of multiple commands.

### Options

* ```:execute => "script"```: the script to execute
* ```:append_to_path => ["dir", "dir"]```: additional places where looking for the script. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/emyl/vagrant-triggers/wiki/The-:append_to_path-option) for details.
* ```:force => true```: continue even if the script fails (exits with non-zero code)
* ```:stdout => true```: display script output
* ```:target => "guest"```: specify the target machine where the script has to be executed (can be "guest" or "host")

### Target

You can specify the target machine on which the script will be executed when the trigger is fired.
NOTE: on ```guest``` target the ```:append_to_path``` option will be ignored

### Skipping execution

Triggers won't run if ```VAGRANT_NO_TRIGGERS``` environment variable is set.

## Example

In the following example a VirtualBox VM (not managed by Vagrant) will be tied to the machine defined in ```Vagrantfile```, to make so that it follows its lifecycle:

```ruby

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  {
    [:up, :resume] => "startvm 22aed8b3-d246-40d5-8ad4-176c17552c43 --type headless",
    :suspend       => "controlvm 22aed8b3-d246-40d5-8ad4-176c17552c43 savestate",
    :halt          => "controlvm 22aed8b3-d246-40d5-8ad4-176c17552c43 acpipowerbutton",
  }.each do |command, trigger|
    config.trigger.before command, :execute => "vboxmanage #{trigger}", :stdout => true
  end
  
end
```
